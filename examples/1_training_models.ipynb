This procedure ensures that the model will have an optical performance while labelling the minimum amount of data.\n",

Other architectures are also available based on [**logistic regressions**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) (`logreg`) and [**random forests**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) (`rf`).
